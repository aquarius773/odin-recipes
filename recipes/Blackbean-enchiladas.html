                <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>

            <h2>Steps to Cook:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. While oven is preheating, in a small bowl, combine the black beans and green chiles.</li>
                <li>Spread about 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of a 9×13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Pour remaining sauce into a shallow bowl or pie plate. Working one at a time, dip tortilla into sauce to lightly coat both sides. Transfer to a plate, then place about 3 tablespoons of the bean mixture into the top center. Top with a few tablespoons of the cheese.</li>
                <li>Roll up and place seam side down in baking dish. Repeat until you’ve used all of the tortillas, placing them close together in the pan.</li>
                <li>Pour the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the enchiladas and sprinkle with remaining shredded cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake enchiladas until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from the oven and allow enchiladas to cool for 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro, green onion, avocado, and queso fresco, if desired. Serve warm.</li>
